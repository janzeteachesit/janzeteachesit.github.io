- [CSD U3 Animations and Games - COde.org](https://studio.code.org/s/csd3) - In Unit 3, you’ll build on your coding experience as you program animations, interactive art, and games in Game Lab. The unit starts off with simple shapes and builds up to more sophisticated sprite-based games, using the same programming concepts and the design process computer scientists use daily. In the final project, you’ll develop a personalized, interactive program.

- [Computing platform - Wikipedia](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Computing_platform) - A computing platform is the environment in which a piece of software is executed. It may be the hardware or the operating system (OS), even a web browser or other underlying software, as long as the program code is executed in it. Computing platforms have different abstraction levels, including a computer architecture, an OS, or runtime libraries.[1] A computing platform is the stage on which computer programs can run.
