- [Computing platform - Wikipedia](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Computing_platform) - A computing platform is the environment in which a piece of software is executed. It may be the hardware or the operating system (OS), even a web browser or other underlying software, as long as the program code is executed in it. Computing platforms have different abstraction levels, including a computer architecture, an OS, or runtime libraries.[1] A computing platform is the stage on which computer programs can run.
