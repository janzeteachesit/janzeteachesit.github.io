Youâ€™ll find this post in your `_posts` directory. Go ahead and edit it and re-build the site to see your changes. You can rebuild the site in many different ways, but the most common way is to run `bundle exec jekyll serve`, which launches a web server and auto-regenerates your site when a file is updated.

To add new posts, simply add a file in the `_posts` directory that follows the convention `YYYY-MM-DD-name-of-post.ext` and includes the necessary front matter. Take a look at the source for this post to get an idea about how it works.

For example, the following are examples of valid post filenames:

  2011-12-31-new-years-eve-is-awesome.md
  2012-09-12-how-to-write-a-blog.md

Tip: Link to other posts
Use the post_url tag to link to other posts without having to worry about the URL's breaking when the site permalink style changes.
